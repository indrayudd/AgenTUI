# AgenTUI

Codex-inspired terminal client that wraps LangChain Deep Agents. The app exposes a full-screen Ink TUI for day-to-day chatting plus a single-shot CLI command that you can use to test the agent deterministically.

## Highlights

- **DeepAgents integration** with OpenAI `gpt-5-mini` by default.
- **Filesystem-aware mentions**: typing `@src/ui/App.tsx` auto-completes paths and turns them into the virtual `/src/ui/App.tsx` references DeepAgents expects.
- **Filesystem harness shortcuts**: natural prompts such as "list the files in @node_modules/" or "search for 'FilesystemBackend' in @src/" automatically call the correct tools (`ls`, `read_file`, `glob`, `grep`, etc.). The shortcuts now understand both the legacy `targetPath` style arguments and DeepAgents' canonical `file_path` / `dir_path` names, so GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5-mini both stay happy.
- **Intent-aware routing** that classifies each prompt as conversational, filesystem, notebook, or mixed so the agent responds naturally when no tools are needed and plans multi-step work when they are.
- **Notebook IQ** – `ipynb_create`, `ipynb_patch`, `ipynb_run`, `ipynb_analyze`, and the new `ipynb_artifacts` tool let the agent create, edit, execute, summarize, and look up artifact locations without manual spelunking. See `docs/notebook-pipeline.md`.
- **Inline CLI mode** via `npm run agent -- "prompt"` for deterministic testing.
- **Reasoning visibility control**: the model emits `ReasoningVisible: yes|no` before every response so greetings stay clean while multi-step/tool work streams a dim gray plan.
- **Natural-language action summaries** so the Actions list reads like “Listed / (23 entries)” instead of raw JSON blobs.
- **Reasoning → Actions → Answer parity** between the TUI and CLI: both surfaces stream plan updates, normalized tool summaries, and a final conversational answer sourced from the same structured event pipeline.
- **Robust path highlighting** keeps entire filenames/paths cyan (even when the agent returns bare filenames like `sprint1_plan.md`) without lighting up random sentences.
- **Slash commands** for `/model`, `/new`, `/undo`, `/files`, `/quit`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill OPENAI_API_KEY
npm run dev             # launch the Ink TUI
```

Build/run the compiled binary with:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

## Environment

`.env` example:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-mini # optional override
```

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Ink TUI with live reload.
| `npm run build` | Type-check and emit JS into `dist/`.
| `npm start` | Run the compiled CLI from `dist/`.
| `npm run test` | Vitest test suite (config loader, session reducer, agent, mention utilities).
| `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` | ESLint checks for `src/`.
| `npm run agent -- "prompt"` | Fire a single prompt without launching the TUI (see below).
| `npm run agent:smoke` | Runs six representative prompts (greeting, listing, summary, notebook creation, notebook summarize, patch+run) via the CLI for a quick end-to-end smoke test. Retries each prompt once if the model hiccups. |
| `npm run agent:testfs` | Filesystem regression harness (resets `tmp/fs-spec`, then exercises list/copy/read/glob/delete prompts against the real workspace). |

### Inline CLI examples

This shares the same mention parsing/high-level behavior as the TUI and is useful for verifying filesystem features:

```bash
npm run agent -- "list the files in @src/"           # uses ls
npm run agent -- "show the first 5 lines of @README.md"  # uses read_file
npm run agent -- "search for 'FilesystemBackend' in @src/"  # uses grep
npm run agent -- "copy @README.md to README.backup"   # custom copy tool
npm run agent -- "delete @README.backup"               # custom delete tool
```

## Slash Commands (in the TUI)

- `/model [name]` – switch models (supported: gpt-5-mini, gpt-5, gpt-5.1, gpt-4o, gpt-4.1, o1, o1-preview, o1-mini). Run `/model` with no args to open the inline picker.
- `/new` – clear the transcript and reset usage.
- `/undo` – remove the last user/agent turn.
- `/files` – toggle the filesystem explorer panel.
- `/quit` or `/exit` – exit AgenTUI.

## CLI Tips

- Keep a second terminal running CLI prompts for iterative development. Example: `npm run agent -- "list the files in @tmp/"`.
- For filesystem-heavy changes, run `npm run agent:testfs` before and after edits to ensure list/copy/read/delete flows continue to work.
- `npm run agent:smoke` is useful after touching prompt routing or notebook behavior—it now exercises greeting, listing, notebook summarization, notebook creation, and a patch → run → artifact listing workflow. See [`docs/notebook-pipeline.md`](docs/notebook-pipeline.md) for the full create → patch → run → summarize → artifacts diagram.

## Filesystem Shortcuts

The app intercepts natural language instructions before they reach the LLM. Every path travels through `src/path/resolver.ts`, which coerces `@mentions`, `~/`, `/examples/...`, or even accidental `/tmp/...` references back into the workspace sandbox before executing anything.

| Shell intent | Example prompts | AgenTUI handler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List directory / `ls` | `list the files in @node_modules/` | `list_path` tool (shortcut + DeepAgents) |
| Read file / `cat`, `head` | `show the first 5 lines of @sprint4_specs.md` | `read_file` tool with byte limit |
| Search / `rg` | `search for "FilesystemBackend" in @src/` | `search_text` (wraps DeepAgents `grep`) |
| Copy / `cp` | `copy @README.md to @tmp/README.copy.md` | Shortcut + `copy_path` tool (handles directories + overwrite) |
| Move / `mv` | `move @tmp/README.copy.md to @tmp/README.archive.md` | Shortcut + `move_path` tool |
| Delete / `rm -rf` | `delete @tmp/README.archive.md` | Shortcut + `delete_path` |
| Make directories / `mkdir -p` | `mkdir @tmp/new_docs` | Shortcut + `make_directory` |
| Diff | `diff @README.md @ARCHITECTURE.md` | Shortcut + `diff_paths` |
| Notebook helpers | `run notebook @examples/notebooks/demo.ipynb` | Notebook tools (create/run/analyze) |
| Glob | `glob "*.test.ts" @src/` | DeepAgents glob tool |

Because these shortcuts run before the LLM sees your message, the agent never wastes tokens trying to reason about basic shell commands and you get deterministic output in both the TUI and `npm run agent -- "..."` mode.

## Reasoning → Actions → Answer Flow

Every turn goes through an intent router that attaches metadata to the prompt:

1. **[Intent] block** – describes whether the user is just chatting or asking for filesystem/notebook work. The agent reads this block before acting so small-talk gets a conversational answer while real tasks trigger planning.
2. **[Mentioned files] block** – lists sandbox-vetted paths derived from `@mentions`, so the model never guesses at arbitrary filesystem locations.

The DeepAgents runner streams structured events that both the CLI and TUI consume:

- `plan` events come from the agent’s `write_todos` planning tool or live reasoning tokens.
- `action` events normalize tool output into user-friendly summaries (e.g., `Listed / (23 entries)` instead of raw JSON).
- `reasoning_visibility` lets the model decide whether to display its plan. When `ReasoningVisible: no`, the UI/CLI hide the Reasoning block entirely; when `yes`, it renders in dim gray text without a heading.
- `answer` events ensure the final assistant turn summarizes exactly what happened, referencing the important actions.
- The router automatically escalates from conversation to filesystem/notebook/image tasks—even if the user simply replies “yes, do it”—so you never have to confirm twice.

The UI and CLI render these events as the familiar **Reasoning → Actions → Answer** sections, so verifying one surface automatically verifies the other.

## Project Structure

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `src/cli.tsx` | Ink entry point. Loads config, spins up the agent, renders the TUI, handles slash commands.
| `src/agent/` | `index.ts` constructs the LangChain deep agent (ChatOpenAI, filesystem backend, delete/copy tools) and exposes a typed runner. `index.test.ts` mocks the pieces to ensure correct wiring.
| `src/config/` | Zod-validated config loader plus tests. `config.ts` exports `loadConfig` used by both TUI and CLI.
| `src/state/` | Session reducer + hook for transcript, usage tracking, context meter.
| `src/ui/` | React components for App layout, footer/composer, file explorer, sidebar, transcript, etc. Includes mention highlighting + tests (`mentions.test.ts`).
| `src/fs/shortcuts.ts` | Natural-language parser that recognizes filesystem intents and calls DeepAgents tools before involving the LLM.
| `src/agent-cli.ts` | Single-shot CLI runner. Applies mention parsing + filesystem shortcuts and prints the agent response.
| `src/commands.ts` | Slash command parser + tests.
| `scripts/deepagents-model-test.ts` | Lightweight script for manually invoking a DeepAgent with arbitrary model/prompt (useful for debugging specific models or backends).

## QA Checklist

1. `npm run typecheck`
2. `npm run test`
3. Inline CLI smoke tests: run the examples above plus `npm run agent -- "hello"` and `npm run agent -- "create a notebook @examples/foo.ipynb"` to confirm the router flips between conversational and tool-driven flows, or use `npm run agent:smoke` to execute the default prompt set sequentially.
4. Filesystem regression: `npm run agent:testfs` to exercise list/copy/read/glob/delete flows against the real `tmp/fs-spec` fixture whenever filesystem changes are introduced.
5. Launch `npm run dev`, exercise slash commands (`/model`, `/new`, `/undo`, `/files`), and watch the dim-gray Reasoning block appear only when meaningful plan output exists.

## Notes

- Mentions resolve relative to the workspace root and the explorer keeps track of real filesystem changes.
- The default model can be overridden via `OPENAI_MODEL` if required. The known context windows are defined in `src/models.ts`.
